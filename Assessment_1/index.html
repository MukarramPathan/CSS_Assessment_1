    <p class="one">What is CSS?</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes hw HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="line">CSS is not necessary</span> <span class="two"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages al at once.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="under">External structure are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="one">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elemental.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <br>
        <li>Extrenal - by using a link element to link to an extrenal CSS file.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS fies. However, <span class="two"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demostrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple element. ID , n the otherhand, appies a style to one unique element. ID is aso special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an eement and it's used by JavaScript.
        <br><br>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of eements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a stye or set of styles can be appied to the elemnet.
        <br><br>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style shoud be applied.
